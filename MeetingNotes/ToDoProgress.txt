Transform Grad-CAM saliency Map into Hidden Markov Models

有的图有不同数量的cluster

Method1:
take all the saliency sample point as 1;
Each sample were assigned the possibility to 1/total_sample;
Put it into Gaussian Mixture function;
And Bayesian Gaussian Model;

Method2:
Each sample in the saliency map were given a weight;
you need to sum up the weights within an area;
Modify the weight;
