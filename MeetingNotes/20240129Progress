To divide the saliency map into three regions based on weight and convert it into an HMM (Hidden Markov Model), you can follow these steps:

1. Sort the saliency map based on the weights in descending order.
2. Divide the sorted saliency map into three equal-sized regions.
3. Assign each region to a hidden state in the HMM.
4. Define the transition probabilities between the hidden states based on the spatial relationships between the regions.
5. Set the emission probabilities for each hidden state based on the saliency values within the corresponding region.
6. Train the HMM using an appropriate algorithm (e.g., Baum-Welch algorithm) to estimate the model parameters.
7. Once the HMM is trained, you can use it to predict the hidden states (regions) for new saliency maps based on their weights and spatial relationships.

Note that this approach assumes the weights of the saliency map are indicative of the importance or relevance of different image regions.
